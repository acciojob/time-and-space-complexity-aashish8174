	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p><b>Time Complexity:</b>ime complexity is defined as the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. It is not going to examine the total execution time of an algorithm 	Time complexity, efficient</p>
	
	<p><b>Space Complexity:</b>Space complexity refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity Space Complexity, O(n).</p>
